# Spotify Playlist Generator

## Summary

This project investigates the potential of machine learning to automate playlist generation for Moosic, a startup currently dependent on human curation. As Moosic aims to scale, this project explores whether machine learning can match or enhance the quality of human curated playlists, making playlist creation more efficient and consistent.

## Key Business Questions

- **Can Spotify’s audio features identify similar songs by human perceived criteria?**
- **Is K-Means clustering a suitable approach for playlist creation?**
  - What are the advantages and limitations?
- **Which audio features should be included or excluded and why?**
- **How effective is the prototype at creating cohesive playlists?**
- **What additional data would improve playlist quality?**
- **What are the next steps if this project moves forward?**

By clustering songs based on Spotify’s audio features and auto generating playlists, this project provides insights into the feasibility of machine learning in playlist curation and outlines potential future actions for Moosic’s technology adoption.
